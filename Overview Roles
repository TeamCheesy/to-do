*** Your To-do Frame**

On the What to expect page you'll find all the aspects of Rails Girls Summer of Code. 
The most important bit for now is to review your project plan and set up the to-dos for the first week(s) 
as well as setting up your work flow, communication tools, Slack etc.

We ask you to keep Lieke in the loop of all major project issues and processes 
such as project plans and changes thereof and 
grant her access to whatever chat tools you might be using. 
Additionally, she'll check in with you about once a week. We totally leave it up to you how to arrange this. 
We did ask GitHub to provide us with free plans for students, but we haven't heard back yet. 
Lieke will contact you once we have more infos on that.

Please note: A supervisor is NOT a project manager. 
You're asked to organize your work flow yourselves incl. chat tools, issue trackers, etc., but, 
of course, can always ask her when you have questions or stumble upon problems.

*** Who's doing what? ***

Since we know that the involved roles might be a bit overwhelming to digest, 
here's a crisp summary who's responsible for what in your team:

* Students *

Roos & Maud: 
Learn, learn, learn :) and work on the project issues. 
Organize your work flow and other todos.

* Coaches *

Andr√©, Hans, Thijs, Yorick, Shannon: 
Work side-to-side with the students, explain code, methods, tools etc. 
Advise in setting up work flow if necessary. 
Plus, advise on the overall project plan and goals (milestones) and have the say in issues to work on. 
Please keep in mind: Learning is more important for us than building tons of features.

* Mentor(s) *
Carsten, Sara and Laura: 
You are the project maintainer(s)/ core contributers and should advise on the project plan, 
the issues the students should work on and are the experts of exercism, 
who can be contacted for all project-related things and keep an eye on the roadmap. 
Carsten will be your first contact person, but since he's expecting a kid any time soon, 
Sara and Laura will jump in whenever he's unavailable :)

* Supervisor *
Lieke: Keep track of the process and be the contact person for all things organizational.

I'll let you take it from here and wish you a great and successful Rails Girls Summer of Code!
Happy Coding!
Anika
